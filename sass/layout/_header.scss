  cover == will always try to fill element of the box
  background-position: top == top of image will be locked on resize (crop out bottom of image to keep visible on resize)
  background-position: center == will crop out top and bottom - to make image stay locked on middle part of photo!
  clip-path: polygon(x y, x y) == specify polygon where the image/thing will still be visible
  clip-path: polygon(50% 0, 100% 100%, 50% 200px, 0 100%) ==> this was kind of cool!
